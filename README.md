# 5)	Main page general considerations
Responsive design, as the layout and the styling changes and adapts to smaller screens than desktop. As well, in the main page, the first background image is replaced by one with a smaller resolution, to maintain an attractive design for smaller screens.
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122981098/222277592-5eaf5278-db2c-4dcb-bfea-e3344b9cc664.png)





The text size becomes smaller and the spacing in between as well to accommodate to a smaller screen (Home page):

# 6)	Footer
The footer is repeating in all the pages and it has links which open is separate windows. It is changing size and alignment to be adjusted for responsive design.

# 7)	Events page
The background image is well matched with the focus of the page. It has responsive design depending on the screen size.

# 9)	Other general considerations
The styling and the colours repeat themselves throughout all the pages, not straining to much the attention of the user and making it easy to navigate.
The links (the ones used in the events time lines and in the footer social media components) are opening in brand new pages, lifting the necessity to use the back button to return to the initial web page. 
Font Awesome icons have been used in line with each paragraph / division content to easily isolate different categories and for an intuitive navigation, which is working toward reducing the effort the users would have to undertake.

The background images are as well matched with each other and with the focus of each page or section of the page. The opening images (there are 2, depending on the monitor size) to the main page are the ones that are visually hinting to the title of the website – “Biohacking” making it even more obvious what is the approached topic and by this accessible.
The background image of the video when the site opens is as well enlightening and offering an additional insight.
As for the background images of the “Events” and “Signup” pages, they are self-explanatory as well and well suited for their content, remaining at the same time catchy and fresh.   
The background images have been taken from Freepick.
The main colours have very bright tones which maintain themselves throughout the pages, that can be as well indicative of the illuminating effect it can have deepening in biohacking and the intent of the topic in general – “Broaden your mind, optimize your life!”/ “Look towards the future and have fun with it!”
The CSS code has been validated with W3C Validator and the HTML code has been as well validated with W3 Validator.
